# User Types

# User & Admin Roles

Both User & Admin have full access to make modifications to all stacks, services, secrets etc. - however, only Admin users can create/edit other users.

# View Only Role

As you would expect, 'View only' users can not make any modifications except pinning/unpinning dashboard entries and changing their password.
With the exception of secret values (which are kept secret to full users and admins), they can view all information.
